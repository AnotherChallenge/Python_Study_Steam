# Analyzing steam store games

Goal: Understanding the profitability and popularity of different types of video games provided by Steam.

Motivation: As I think about the growth of online gaming, my main focus has always been on examining games not just for fun but also from a business perspective. 
This interest began during my research at CareerFoundry, where I analyzed a dataset that covered game sales in different regions, genres, platforms, and countries.
